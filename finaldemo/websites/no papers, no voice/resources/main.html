        <p>The Know Your Rights Red Cards were created to help people assert their rights and defend themselves against constitutional violations. Knowing and asserting rights can make a huge difference in many situations, such as when ICE agents go to a home. Red cards provide critical information on how to assert these rights, along with an explanation to ICE agents that the individual is indeed asserting their rights.</p>

        <li><h1><a href=https://www.ilrc.org/red-cards-tarjetas-rojas>Red Card Printables</a></h1></li>
        <p>The ILRC's red cards give examples of how people can exercise these rights in real situations, such as when ICE agents go to a home. However, they do not provide individualized legal advice. The artwork for printing your own cards is available on this website. These are formatted as standard 3.5” by 2” business cards. Translated versions are designed to support monolingual immigrants translate their rights with immigration officers.</p>
