">This project is a powerful representation of the struggles and experiences of undocumented individuals in the U.S., with a particular focus on the mass deportations currently unfolding. Its purpose is to shed light on the fear, pain, and resilience within the Hispanic immigrant community. 

        The centerpiece of the project is a translation machine made of petri dishes, each containing words or sentences that represent these experiences. These dishes are set in an environment (shed) that contains mold. As the mold grows over the words in the petri dishes, it symbolizes the systemic oppression, silence, and trauma endured by the community. Many immgirants are not aware of their constitutional rights, it is important to know and remind others that everyone has the right to exercise constitutional rights regardless of migration status. The final result reveals the words and letters that remain uncovered, creating a commentary on the lasting impact of these struggles.</p>
